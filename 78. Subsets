Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]


l = [1,2,3]

def powerset(xs):
    result= [[]]
    for x in xs:
        print("this is x",x)
        newsubsets = [subset + [x] for subset in result]
        print("newsubsets",newsubsets)
        result.extend(newsubsets)
        print("result",result)
    return result

print(powerset(l))

output============
this is x 1
newsubsets [[1]]
result [[], [1]]
this is x 2
newsubsets [[2], [1, 2]]
result [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]
this is x 3
newsubsets [[3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
result [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
