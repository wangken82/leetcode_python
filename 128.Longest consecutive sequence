Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.


def longestCon(nums):
    
    nums.sort()
    res=0
    k=1
    for i in range(1,len(nums)):
        if nums[i]==nums[i-1]+1:
            k+=1
            res = res if res>k else k
        else:
            k=1
    return res

longestCon([100,4,200,1,3,2,101,104,102,103,1067,8])
